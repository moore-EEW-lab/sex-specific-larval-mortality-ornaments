#Manuscript Title: Ornamented species incur higher male mortality in the larval stage

#Year: 2023

#File Name: drags.larval.sex.ratio.csv
#Description: Species’ traits of dragonflies that were used for the analyses to test the relationship between male wing coloration and population sex ratio at the end of the larval period. Species in this analysis are those that are present in a pruned, maximum credibility phylogeny that was produced by Letsch et al. 2016 (Molecular Ecology). The pruned version of the phylogeny used in the analyses for these data has the file name ‘drags.larval.sex.ratio.phylo.tre’. The R scripts that use this dataset are named “annotated code for larval sex ratio analysis.R”. 
#Rows: 141, including the header. Each row corresponds to a population 
#Columns: 7. binom, prop.male, male.wing.color, male.size, source for larval sex ratio, estim col amount, source for est col amount

#binom: Name of the dragonfly species

#prop.male: the percentage of males that emerged from the pond (lower values indicate that lower larval survival)

#male.wing.color: whether or not the species possesses male ornamentation in the adult stage

#male.size: species’ body length of adult males (mm), taken from Waller et al. 2019 Sci Dat

#source for larval sex ratio: the record from which population sex ratios were taken

#estim col amount: measurement of the proportion of the wing area that is melanized within ornamented species. 

#source for est col amount: the record from which estimated col amount was taken. ODP is the Odonate Phenotypic Database (Waller et al. 2019, Sci Dat) and Hersch & Moore 2023 is a recent study in Biological Journal of the Linnean Society that measured wing coloration for Libelluloidea species.
